# Project 2 - *Wordle*

Submitted by: **Youngjun Yoo**

**Wordle** is an app that gives players six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. 

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- ✅ User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- ✅ User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- ✅ User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- ✅ User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- ✅ App displays a reset button on the top left to reset the game (but make no changes to the settings)

## Notes

This part was smooth and much more interesting as I got used to Swift syntax and pretty much understood optionals and unwrapping the optionals with if-let syntax.
